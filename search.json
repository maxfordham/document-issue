    "text": "Notes from J6865\nexample: 6865 WOOD WHARF PHASE 3 J1-J3 (but probably the same for all Canary Wharf Projects)\nCanary Wharf QA process required: Authored By and Checked By fields\nDiscussion from Pete B (Project Engineer for Project)\n\nWe have used the engineer and project leader fields elsewhere to cover author and checked_by. However the distinction may get lost in translation. Plus our more obstinate clients are asking for author and checked_by unique not only to the current document (1) but also for the document’s history (2). The project leader field I imagine is set more globally, if automated.\n\nshowing current author and checked_by are hard to object to. Whilst, as far as I can see, there’s nothing explicit in ISO 19650, I think it probably is implicit in the fact that a document controller (who knows nothing about the technical content) can somehow independently accept\non behalf of the appointing party that the document is suitable to be shared. For a simple and commonly used indication that it has been checked by someone who didn’t originally draft it. (two pairs of eyes have seen it) the initials of the people involved is a practical way of this. It does also avoid personal identifiable information entering public domain (even if unintentional) which I also agree is important.\nWe have had QA rejections unfortunately from clients wanting to see the initials appear in the revision history. I don’t see why they need &gt; this since the information about authoring and checking is out of date and we don’t retain other out of date information in the document (it would become contradictory, nonsensical and unreadable). However it has been habit for a long time and other consultants readily do it. In isolation it seems such a small request that I’m not prepared to waste time arguing against it. Unless perhaps at the draft BEP stage if we spot &gt; it. I’m sure others will feel the same.",

Where possible, it is always better to run as 2no independent projects as described above. This can be done as a last resort, only if the Project Team has realised too late the projects are independent but have already started recording Time.\n\n\nThe client is the same and we have probably been asked to provide Fees at the same time. There should probably be multiple bid documents for each project, but there may not be. The projects will be procured independently, and may or may not have the same contractor and/or design team parties.\n\nDesign Information: multiple packs of design information. Each project has its own schedules and specification.\nProject Team: 2no project teams (though it may be the same team on both).\nDocument Management: 2no project codes. 2no issue historys.\nJob Folder/ WebApp/ Project Mail: 2no J:\\drive folders. 1no fee earning project, 1no zero fee project in WebApp. The 2nd WebApp project allows for a different project team to be assigned and supports creation of another job folder. The 2nd WebApp project must not have any work-types associated and will be explicitly given 0 Fee in Fee Manager. This way it is impossible to associate time to it in Timesheets and it will have no Fee associated to it, with all Fee managed through the primary job.\nResourcing, Billing and Spend: Resourcing / Timesheets / Billing via a single project.\n\n\nJustification\nWhilst this is not recommended and 2no independent projects is always preferred, sometimes splitting the Time Management and Billing is no longer an option (for example, if work has already been done and assigned to the old job number). In those scenario’s it is still beneficical to split the job for the following reasons:\n\nClearly defining responsibilities of a Project Team for a specific project\nAvoid “nesting” of Design Information within a job folder\nIt ensures that there is accurate mapping between our Design Information and our information in WebApp. Currently automation tools (pyRevit, Digital Schedules) use the WebApp data to retrieve the Project Name from the Project Number, ensuring that this information is consistent across the project. As our Digitalisation journey continues more information will be centrally stored in this way, improving project automation and ultimately reducing the administrative burden of delivering a project.\nAutodesk Construction Cloud is “project-centric”… more here…\nIt is acknowledged that multiple projects for the same Client are likely to have to common reference information (e.g. 2no buildings on a University Campus). In this Scenario it is up to the Project Teams to communicate and come up with a plan to manage this. It would likely require either choosing a single project as a common location to keep shared information and using shortcuts to link to it from the other project, or accepting that duplicate information will be required.",

The structure is compliant with BS EN ISO 19650-2. The information fields defined here may not be required to be output in every document issued, but the aspiration is that no issued document will require any additional data-fields to those defined here. For internal use it is suggested that all the information fields are competed to ensure a consistent record of issued information is maintained.\nAs a suite of tools, the packages in the document-issue monorepo provide:\n\na schema and datastore of the document-issue meta-data that accompanies every document\na simple application interface for users to manage the issue history of documents on a project\na Revit toolbar to support Revit sync\nstandardised report format document templates for schedules and other report style documents\n\n\n\nThis project is structured as a monorepo.
