Quarto (pandoc probs) automatically applies document properties to the generated pdf document.
This document shows that, though "subtitle" appears not to be supported.

**TODO**: 
- ensure that these properties still come through when generating document using the 
  `document-issue` extension.
- chat to IT about adding some of these properties to the default file explorer view.
