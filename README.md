`document-issue` information defines the metadata required to accompany every issued document during the course of
an AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) project.

Generally speaking each document must contain the following information to situate it within a project:

- a unique code, name, title and summary description
- categorisation information that defines to what the document pertains
- when it was issued, at what version
- by who
- for what purpose

The `document-issue` package formalises those information fields and
defines a schema for storing them consistently. The structure is compliant
with BS EN ISO 19650-2. The information fields defined here may not be required to be
output in every document issued, but the aspiration is that no issued document
will require any additional data-fields to those defined here. For internal use it
is suggested that all the information fields are competed to ensure a consistent
record of issued information is maintained.

As a suite of tools, the packages in the **document-issue** monorepo provide:

- a schema and datastore of the `document-issue` meta-data that accompanies every document
- a simple application interface for users to manage the issue history of documents on a project
- a Revit toolbar to support Revit sync
- standardised report format document templates for schedules and other report style documents

## Repo-structure

This project is structured as a monorepo. In the `packages` directory, each package is built and installable independently. Using the VS Code you can open the monorepo as a multi-package workspace defined in `.vscode/document-issue.code-workspace`.

## Packages

- `document-issue`: schema definitions (as pydantic models) defining document-issue information fields.
  - ***future*** *Includes logic for building document codes from categorisation fields.*
- `document-issue-io`: provides input/output functionality. Currently its main use is to define the markdown first couple of pages for report format documents.
- `document-issue-quarto`: defines the quarto/latex templates for creating branded report format documents. Used with `document-issue-io`.
- ***future*** *`document-issue-api`: API and associated database that maintains a reference of documents issued across projects.*
- ***future*** *`document-issue-ui`: user application for Engineers and Project Administrators for creating document codes and recording issued documents.*
- `document-issue-xl`: excel DNG and issue sheet generation
- ***future*** *`document-issue-pyrevit`: pyRevit toolbar to create sheets and views by interacting with the `document-issue-api`.*

```{Note}
for now, `document-issue` intentionally avoids considering the datafields that
are used to create the Document Number, this may follow up in the future.
