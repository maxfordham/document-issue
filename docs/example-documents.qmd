The metadata saved in `document-issue` is used to make title blocks and other information on issued documents.
The `document-issue-io` section contains template examples of:

- generic titleblocks
- report format documents (A4 and A3)
- issue sheet and issue history documents

The `document-issue-quarto` section contains simple text to demonstrate how certain elements of [quarto-markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) text
will be formatted when rendered as pdf using the `document-issue-quarto` extension.
